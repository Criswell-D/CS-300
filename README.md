# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  For the projects in this course a computer science department at ABCU needed to be able to access course information for students. The projects built on one another starting with pseudocode and working up to a final program. The program needed to be able to take in course information and allow the advisors to sort through it. They needed to be able to make lists to review with their students.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand?

  Different data sturctures work better for certain applications. It's important to know the differences between them so you know which one to implement in your project. For this problem I looked over what data was given and what needed to be done with it to figure out how I would go about developing the project. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  For any roadblocks or problems I encountered I would first look back at the lesson for assistance. I also reached out to my professor for an issue I was having. There were also additional resources provideseperate from the lesson hat I reviewed as wel.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  I realised how important it is to have a plan together before starting to develop. Being able to look back at the pseudocode as a reminder was helpful if I got stuck or when I came back to the program aftering taking a break from developing it.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I did know the importance in writing clean that meets industry standards. This project helped to reinforce that by showing me I need to save and test my code for errors more often. Typos and other small mistakes would have been easier to locate if I would have tested more often.
